# Rl-for-finance
## OVERVIEW
This project would be dealing with applications of reinforcement learning algorithms to stock training and portfolio optimization.

## PROGRESS REPORT
* 8th - 15th may
  - Basic introduction to Reinforcement Learning with the help of [blogs](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/reinforcement-learning-part-1-a-brief-introduction-a53a849771cf)
  - Studied potential role of [RL in finance](https://analyticsindiamag.com/reinforcement-learning-in-finance-a-newbie-in-portfolio-selection-and-allocation/)
* 15th - 25th may
  - Formal introduction to Reinforcement Learning by David Silver's [rl course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)
  - Completed first five lectures as suggested by mentor
* 25th - 4th june
  - Completed youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMk_XtIEzH8&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7) of sendtex on rl, code [here](https://github.com/kritin7/rl-for-finance/blob/main/mountain%20car%20simulation%20using%20rl.py).

* 5th june to 12th june
  - Implemented value iteration method to solve frozen lake gridworld problem, code [here](https://github.com/kritin7/rl-for-finance/blob/main/gridworld.ipynb)
* 13th june to 20th june
  - Learnt module named Tensortrade with the help of [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/trade-smarter-w-reinforcement-learning-a5e91163f315)
  - Due to many glitches in this library, this was dropped after discussion with mentor
* 21st june to 5th july
  - Learnt about stock trading and tried implementing various technical indicators such as moving avg,bollinger bonds etc, [code here](https://github.com/kritin7/rl-for-finance/blob/main/stockprediction%20ai.ipynb)
* 5th - 17th july
  - Created a stock trading environment by defining observation,action and building a reward function for training our agent,code [here](https://github.com/kritin7/rl-for-finance/blob/main/stock%20trading%20env.ipynb)

* 17th-27th july (tentative)
  - Incorporating more feature in the environment
  - Training model on different rl algoritm and comparing results with different dataset.
